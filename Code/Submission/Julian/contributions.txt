Adrian and I contributed to the group coursework equally. I was in charge of creating
KNN, spatial pyramids (grayscale/RBG) and SIFT (RGB), automation of the program and 
saving data to CSV files. Adrian coded the SVM, Fisher algorithm, SIFT and we both
collaborated on the presentation in the final stages.
